# SCI Quest Decoder

This decodes and extracts the graphics from classic Sierra SCI adventure games such as Space Quest 3.

This supports SCI0 games (EGA), not SCI1 (VGA).

This generates big uncompressed PNGs. To compress them, install `pngquant` and `apngasm` then run `make compress` to make them all a reasonable size.

## New Years Mystery

Includes [Doan Sephim's New Years Mystery](https://sciprogramming.com/fangames.php?action=review&id=3) SCI fangame so you can run this without needing a game.
